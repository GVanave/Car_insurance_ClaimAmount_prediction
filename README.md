# Car Insurance Claim Amount Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict car insurance claim prices using machine learning techniques. The provided .pynb file contains the code and necessary documentation to perform this prediction task.

## Contents
- **price_prediction_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various factors related to car insurance claims. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, vehicle type, location, etc., along with the corresponding insurance claim prices.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    https://github.com/GVanave/Car_insurance_ClaimAmount_prediction.git
    ```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook car_insurance_claim_prediction.ipynb
    ```

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE).

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful information from the dataset.
- Gather more data to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
